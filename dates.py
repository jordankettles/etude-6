#name all in the same case, all with the first letter upper-case.
#seperators could be space, / or -

#calcutate whether the date is valid (29th of Feb)

#if the year is two numbers, it lies between 1950 and 2049.
#if >49 +1900 else +2000

#check if the first letter is uppercase:
#all follwing letters have to be the same case.

#if the first letter is lowercase:
#all following letters have to be lowercase.
